zotero-report-cleaner
=====================

Tidies up the reports generated by the Zotero reference manager


This is a fork of @jasonpriem's report cleaner. I'm in the process of modernizing it and
adding what's required to deploy it to heroku. Feel free to fork away.

@jasonpriem's orignal project and site can be found below:
- [Report Cleaner site](http://jasonpriem.org/projects/report_cleaner.php)
- [Github Porject](https://github.com/jasonpriem/zotero-report-cleaner)
