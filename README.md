zotero-report-cleaner
=====================

Tidies up the reports generated by the Zotero reference manager

This is a fork of @jasonpriem's report cleaner. I'm in the process of modernizing it.

The site has been deployed to heroku and can be found [here](https://zotero-report-cleaner.herokuapp.com/).
PRs welcome and feel free to fork away.
